# Music Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to help users interact with musical notes and chords. These tools are particularly useful for musicians, students, and enthusiasts who want to deepen their understanding of music theory, practice chord progressions, and explore transposition and scale analysis.

## Features

### 1. **Chord Breakdown**
   - Enter chord names (e.g., `Cmaj`, `G7`) to see their note components.
   - Supports traditional triads, extended chords, and more.

### 2. **Scale Degree Analysis**
   - Displays the scale degrees of each chord in a specified scale (e.g., major, minor, Lydian).
   - Helps users understand the relationship between chords and their scales.

### 3. **Chord Transposition**
   - Transpose chords by intervals or semitone values.
   - Save transposed chords to a file for later review.

### 4. **Session-Based File Output**
   - All transposed chords from a session are saved to a single file after the session ends.
   - Ensures a clean and organized output for practice or reference.
